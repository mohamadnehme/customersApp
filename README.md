# cutomersApp

To run the project you must open 2 terminals preferably; one for the backend, the other for the frontend;

-backend terminal:

First make sure you are in the right path (../backend> ), then type:

npm install then npm start

this will start your backend using Mongodb and express.

-frontend terminal:

First make sure you are in their right path (../frontend> ), then type:

npm install then npm start

this will start your react frontend and it will run on your browser.

When starting the project you will have a navbar with 2 elements (Customer App element is not included) :

Customers List: you will be shown a list of all customers in the database, and creation customer form at the top of the list. You can add, edit, delete a customer. when adding or editing a user, phone number will be validated, name and address is required.

Validate Phone Number: simple interface where you enter a number and check if its valid or not. If number is valid then; country name, country code and provider name will be shown. If number is not valid it will just tell you that it isn't.

Hope that was helpful.
